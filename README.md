# Shrtr

Shrtr is a small rack appliance to handle redirects between short URL paths on
one domain, to full URLs on any other.

It reads in a Yaml configuration file containing static mappings, and will 301
redirect to the destination when provided.

Any other URL is redirected to a specified fall-back.

The YML mappings for my own use are generated by a Jekyll static site, but could
either represent a manual list, or be replaced with a base-60 conversion where
IDs make for appropriate slugs.
